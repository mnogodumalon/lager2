I understand the tech stack, design philosophy, and data persistence requirements.\n\nI'm powered by Claude Haiku 4.5 and have access to search and read-only file operations to explore your codebase.\n\nA few key things I'm keeping in mind:\n\n- **Design system first**: All styles go in `index.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` using semantic HSL tokens\n- **No custom inline styles**: Components use design system variants exclusively\n- **Data persistence mandatory**: Any data-driven app needs LivingApps integration (create app → generate types → wire API)\n- **Beautiful, not complex**: Less is more unless specifically requested\n- **Your users aren't developers**: Keep the UI simple and intuitive\n\nI'm ready for your request!
